when you write fft to count something make sure you want the count actully or you just need to check if this value appered in final answer or not ?
if you don't care of count make sure to minmize the answer in fft function in last loop with min 
to be like that :

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result[i] = round(fa[i].real());
    
    for(auto &i : result)i=min(i , 1ll);
